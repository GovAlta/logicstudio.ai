There are efforts underway to knock down interprovincial trade barriers to enhance competitiveness.\n*   **Job Market:** The Canadian economy added 76,000 jobs. Key job growth is happening in Toronto and across Canada. However, Canada Post is facing a \"critical financial situation\" and has laid off nearly 50 employees.\n\n**Social Issues**\n\n*   **Healthcare:** Provinces are facing challenges in healthcare, including potential cuts to drug treatment for a young girl in B.C. Barriers to cancer treatment in Canada continue to be a struggle for patients and doctors. Alberta Surgical Group defended its actions regarding health contracts.\n*   **Crime and Safety:** Police in Thunder Bay arrested 12 individuals accused of hacking intimate images of more than 100 victims. Charges have been laid against youths after a 13-year-old boy was found dead at an Edmonton LRT station.
