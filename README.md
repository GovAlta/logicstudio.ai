## Usage

### Getting Started

Upon launching LogicStudio.ai, you'll be presented with a blank canvas. The top toolbar provides options to manage your canvases, import/export configurations, and control the zoom level.

### Adding Components

1. **Open the Canvas Toolbar**

   On the left side of the canvas, find the toolbar with various component options.

2. **Select a Component**

   Click on the desired component (e.g., Agent, Input, Output) to add it to the canvas.

3. **Position the Component**

   Drag the newly added component to your preferred location on the canvas.

### Connecting Components

1. **Initiate Connection**

   Click and drag from an output socket (right side) of one component to an input socket (left side) of another.

2. **Establish the Connection**

   Release the drag on the target input socket to create a connection represented by a line.

3. **Manage Connections**

   Click on a connection line to select or delete it using the `Delete` or `Backspace` keys.

### Configuring Components

Each component has customizable properties:

- **AgentCard:**
  - Select AI models.
  - Configure system and user prompts.
  - Trigger AI processing and monitor status.

- **InputCard:**
  - Upload files via drag-and-drop or file selection.
  - Rename, refresh, or remove uploaded files.

- **OutputCard:**
  - Choose output formats (Markdown, DOCX, PDF, JSON, TXT).
  - Download individual outputs or all exports as a ZIP archive.

- **JoinCard:**
  - Combine multiple inputs with a specified separator.

- **TextCard:**
  - Edit text with support for breakpoints and segments.
  
- **LabelCard:**
  - Add and edit titles and subtitles for annotative purposes.

- **ViewCard:**
  - Display content as JSON or Markdown.
  - Copy content directly to the clipboard.

### Canvas Management

- **Add Canvas:**
  Click the `+` button on the top toolbar to create a new canvas.

- **Switch Canvases:**
  Use the left and right arrows beside the canvas name to navigate between canvases.

- **Close Canvas:**
  Click the close (`Ã—`) button to remove the current canvas.

### Importing & Exporting
